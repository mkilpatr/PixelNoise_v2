DPGAnalysis-SiPixelTools
========================

These are various codes to calibrate & test pixels:

PixelTriplets - measure hit resolution in bpix using the triplet method.

PixelTrees - make pixel trees used for testing and calibration of resonstructin

PixelHitAsociator - a customised version of the SimHit-RecHit comparion, used for resolution testing.

HitAnalyser - various codes to test pixel simHits, digis, clusters and recHits.

LA-Calibration - code to calibrate the LA from data.

GainCalibration - code to run the gain calibartion to obtain pedestals and (offsets) gains (slopes) per pixel.

PixelDBTools - various test programs to monitor the content of pixel DB payloads.
